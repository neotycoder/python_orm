Description: I decided to build this script as a reference to myself on how to build an ORM.
I'll be using this to build a administrative gui I've been thinking of doing for awhile now.

What is an ORM?
ORM stands for Object Relational Model. To sum it up, your building a relational database, but that's a really simple definition.

Reference this link for more comprehensive details on what an ORM is about and other examples. (Why reinvent the wheel? I'd just be doing it to satisfy my own ego.)
